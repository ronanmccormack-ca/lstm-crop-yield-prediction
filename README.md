# Long Short-Term Memory Crop Yield Prediction
The aim of this project is to develop a crop yield prediction model for wheat in Alberta between 2005 and 2015 using long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. The model will use weather and soil data to predict the crop yield for the following year. 
The prediction of crop yield can help farmers and policymakers to make informed decisions about crop management and food security. LSTM neural networks have shown promising results in predicting time-series data, making them a suitable choice for this project. 
The results of this study could provide insights into the crop yield prediction of wheat in Alberta and could potentially be used in other regions with similar climatic conditions.<br>
